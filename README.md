# HackSnooze

This application allows users to create an account and login(if you have already registered). If a user already has a login, they can login and create feeds that will show on the UI and will be sent to an api to be saved in the database. The user has the ability to favorite any feed and delete only feeds created by them. This is a live feed, so data is always being added. User's created and favorites feeds will be saved and restored upon reentering the site.
